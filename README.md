## Guessing Game
To understand different realms of software development, I am starting to build some small games in rust. I wish to do it in the __'The Rust Way'__.

If you want to learn or understand about rust. The preffered resources are :
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Let's Get Rusty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX9HJsJUDxA&list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&pp=iAQB)

It's important to maintain interest while going through these resources, so my advice is to practice the syntax by making small programs.

**Important Note :** Rust is not considered good enough by new programmers _(coz they are comfortable with python & js, which is not a good habit)_, but Rust is a good way to know about low-level programming and how high-level languages works.

### _BTW chekout my programming setup:_
